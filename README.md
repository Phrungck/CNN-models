## Convolutional Neural Networks
In this repository you will find a list of different CNN model implementations I have created over the years. These are simplified versions which allowed me to understand the reasoning behind architecture choices. Enjoy!

**PS. Year pertains to the date I created the script which also shows my coding style.**

## Dependencies
* PyTorch

## Model List:
* Inception Model: this pertains to the mini_googlenet python script // (https://github.com/Phrungck/CNN-models/blob/main/mini_googlenet.py)
