## Convolutional Neural Networks
In this repository you will find a list of different CNN model implementations I have created over the years. These are simplified versions which allowed me to understand the reasoning behind architecture choices. Enjoy!

**PS. Year pertains to the date I created the script which also shows my coding style.**

## Dependencies
* PyTorch
